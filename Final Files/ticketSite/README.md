# Django Ticketing System Web App

This directory is the root directory for the Django Web Application. It contains all of the files in the main django application directory for the ticketing system web application.
It contains important files used to create the ticketing system where SIEM data is visualized and represented to help with ticket resolution.

The files that make up the website layout and contents are found in /ticketApp/templates. That directory contains the HTML files that make up each web page. The files in that directory are inspired by 
the resources listed in the table below. They were updated over the course of the project with new functionality, and updated visuals, but the basis 
for the code was inspired by the resources below:
