## Directory Overview

The files listed in the ticketApp directory are the files to make up the django application website after being integrated with the SIEM functionality and parsing scripts
that I have written. This code is updated from the original code, includes updated visuals for the web page , a sliding window containing interactable kibana dashboards, and a view of the Elasticsearch query parsing script results output. 


**NOTE**
The ticketApp directory only contains the files that were edited by me. It DOES NOT contain all files necessary for the Web Application to run.


The code in this directory is inspired by the resource listed below:
