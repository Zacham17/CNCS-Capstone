## Pre Sprint Website Files

The files listed in this directory are the initial files that I started with for the basic ticketing site
developed in Django for this capstone project. The code in this directory is directly inspired by the resource listed  in the table below. These files closely resemble the original code now, but are greatly updated in future sprints.
