# Website Files

This directory contains the files that make up the ticketing system web page. This directory does not show all of the files for the Django web 
application, but just for the website itself. The basis of the code for these files was inspired by the references listed in the table below. These files were updated 
and edited from their original versions to add my own contents and functionality.
